Introduction
This project leverages GCP's powerful tools for data storage, processing, and visualization. BigQuery is used as the data warehouse for storing and querying large datasets, while Looker Studio provides a user-friendly interface for creating and sharing data visualizations.

Features
Data Storage: Utilize BigQuery datasets to store structured data.
Data Analysis: Perform complex queries on large datasets using BigQuery's SQL-like syntax.
Visualization: Create interactive dashboards and visualizations with Looker Studio.
Scalability: Scale your data analysis infrastructure as needed with GCP's flexible cloud platform.
Collaboration: Share insights and collaborate with team members using Looker's collaborative features.
